Is it 'expensive' or 'cheap'? \n- The least difficult of the 3 over a long time horizon (Years). \n- Hard because expensive things can keep getting more expensive, cheap things can keep getting cheaper etc.\n- Difficult due to noise/randomness in the movements of the market, but can be used in mean-reversion strategies.\n\n\u2705 2. Is it 'trending up' or 'trending down'?\n- Often wrong in ranging markets, but gives exposure to the large sweeping moves when they occur.\n- Harder than #1,  but still easier than #3...\n\n\u274c 3. Where is it going next and when? \n- Impossible to answer, but easy to ask, hence why its the first question most idiots ask.\n\nNo one REALLY knows where anything is going in 3-6 months, but we have probabilistic methods of entering the market when there is a high probability of making money.\n\nExpanding on this in the following video, you'll learn about:\n\u2705 Indicator types\n\u2705 Indicator sub-types\n\u2705 What to do if you miss the best entry",
