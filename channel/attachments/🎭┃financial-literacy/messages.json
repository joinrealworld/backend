It's like 'The Hobbit' but with more inflation\nC At a certain point in history money was pegged to the amount of gold that a country had. If a country wanted to print more money, it would have to own the gold to back it up. -",

They take only a small portion of customers\u2019 deposits and lend out the rest, knowing full well that not all customers will want to withdraw their funds at the same time. -\nD This allows banks to create more loans and make more money while putting customers' deposits at risk. It's basically legal counterfeiting.",

They also need to pay a $500 deposit which they get back if they get more than 5% of the total votes in their constituency.\nC Central banks are typically overseen by a board of directors or governors, who are appointed by the government or other relevant authorities.
