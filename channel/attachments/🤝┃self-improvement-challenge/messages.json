However, it is adamant you work on EVERY ASPECT OF YOURSELF!\n\u200e\nPorn is poison. And is currently one of the greatest addictions of our generation.\n\nIt predates on a man's primal desire to reproduce with attractive females. It's cheap, and it's everywhere.\n\u200e\nAnd most importantly - it's being weaponized as a tool to keep you weak and controllable.\n\u200e\nWomen are the biggest weakness for men.\n\u200e\nI don't want this to be some bullshit 'No Nut January' where you accomplish zero and just talking about your peeps.\n\u200e\nThis is meant to transform you from a weak kid, to a strong man.\n\u200e\nLet's lay the rules for the program:\n\u200e\n> **1-** NO PORN. NO SOFT NUDITY OR ANYTHING\n> \u200e\n> **2-** NO SOCIAL MEDIA. Delete your Instagram and Facebook.\n> Note- if you use it for business, it's fine to keep. Delete all females from your following list tho.\n> \u200e\n> **3-** No masturbation, edging or whatever. Only touch your thingie when you go to pee. Nothing else\n> \u200e\n> **4-** YOU WILL DO SOMETHING PHYSICAL - DAILY. I don't care if it's a gym, fighting, or just pushups.\n> \u200e\n> **5-** YOU WILL SET A 'MILLIONAIRE ACCESS' GOAL TO ACCOMPLISH WITH A $ AT THE END.\n> \u200e\n> **6-** YOU WILL POST EVERY SINGLE DAY IN <#1125536055609786501>.",
