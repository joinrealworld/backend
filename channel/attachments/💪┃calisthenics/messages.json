         "content":"**Bodyweight Training \u25031**\n\n> Bodyweight training has high benefits for the body.\n> \n> Many people believe you cannot build muscle mass just by doing bodyweight training.\n> \n> However, if we look at gymnasts, we can notice the most aesthetic, shredded bodies.\n> \n> Bodyweight training is also excellent for reducing the risk of injuries.\n> \n\n\n\n**Bodyweight Training \u25032**\n\n> This type of training builds a strong foundation for your abs and lower back, known as your core, which can help prevent and ameliorate spine problems.\n> \n> Exercises used in this type of training involve multiple muscle groups which work in synergy to create an aesthetic and strong body.\n> \n> Building a harmonious physique is very easy.\n> \n> You only need some basic exercises.\n> \n> The purpose is to maintain optimum muscular intensity, in order to increase strength and muscle mass.\n\n\n\n\n**Bodyweight Training \u25033**\n\n> The given workout has multiple difficulties and should be done 3 to 6 times a week.\n> \n> Your focus for muscle mass should include the main muscle groups and functional movement:\n> \n>  \u2022 Squats.\n>  \u2022 Lunges.\n>  \u2022 Push-ups.\n>  \u2022 Dips.\n>  \u2022 Abs.\n>  \u2022 Plank.\n\n\n\n\n\n***A very important aspect is time under tension!***\n\n> Most people who work out spend 20-25 seconds on a set.\n> \n> In order to gain muscle mass, the sets should keep the muscles under tension for 40 to 60 seconds, and in some cases for 60 to 80 seconds.\n> \n> Example of time under tension, or tempo 2-0-X-0:\n> \n> The first number is the downward phase of the movement, also known as eccentric.\n> \n> You move down for two seconds.\n> The second number represents the time in seconds to pause at the lower end of the movement. In this case, there is no pause.\n> \n> The third number is the upward movement, also known as concentric. In this case, X means explosive.\n> \n> The fourth number represents the time in seconds to pause at the upper end of the movement. Again, there is no pause.\n\n\n\n\n**Time under tension is more important than the total number of reps.**\n\n__For a tempo of 4-1-2-0, you will train like this:__\n\n> \u2022 4 seconds eccentric - Under load (Release/Lengthening)\n> \n> \u2022 1 second pause at the end of the movement (Isometric)\n> \n> \u2022 2 seconds concentric - (Flex/Shortening)\n> \n> No pause at the bottom, immediate start of a new rep\n\n__BREATHING PATTERN__\n\n> \u2022 Breath in on the eccentric movement.\n> \n> \u2022 Breath out on the concentric movement.\n\n__Example of Pushup__\n\n> \u2022 4 seconds starting from up position with your arms straight, go with the chest at the ground level in 4 seconds.\n> \n> \u2022 1 second in down position, arms are flexed chest is wide open.\n> \n> \u2022 2 seconds push the body up until arms are perfectly straight.\n> \n> \u2022 0 immediately begin the next rep as soon as the arms are perfectly straight.\n\n\n\n\n**Before we take a look at the workout, please visualize the body in 3 parts.**\n\n> \u2022 Upper body \u2013 chest, triceps, back, biceps, shoulders.\n> \n> \u2022 Middle body \u2013 core, abs, spinal erectors.\n> \n> \u2022 Lower body \u2013 glutes, thighs, calves, hamstrings.",
