In medium term, the asset is just the vehicle for the technique\" - Prof Adam\n> \n> As you can see from the BTC and ETH example, extreme gains can be made. But more can be made if you choose the right asset.\n> \n> If you believe that ETH is going to outperform BTC, you wouldn\u2019t hold BTC.\n> \n> If you believe SONIC-OBAMA token is going to outperform ETH & BTC you wouldn\u2019t buy either right?\n> \n> This is the *black hole* all new investors fall into. Buying absolute shit because they hope it has more upside based off nothing but some propaganda.\n> \n> In the investing series we will be covering *Modern Portfolio Theory* and using it to select the optimal assets.\n> \n> MPT is the best quantitative method for selecting assets, and I will be showing you not only how to use it, but how to also improve it.\n\n***What technique we will use (S.DCA)***\n\n> The technique we will use to invest in our assets will be Strategic Dollar Cost Averaging\n\n> This is where you\u2019ll be using indicators to value BTC then buy dollar cost averaging when the value is sensible\n\n> This is the highest likelihood method of accurately buying the dip\n\n***How we will time our technique (Aggregate valuation scoring)***\n\n> Using the principles we have learned in the statistics section, we will perform a wide array of valuation analysis.\n\n> We will combine valuation scores to increase accuracy via Z-scoring\n\n***Speed of buying and selling (Requires knowledge of the future)***\n\n> Rate of buying and selling will be the most difficult and least accurate part of the long term series, as to know the correct speed, by definition we must know the future. Which is impossible.\n\n> We can make some rough approximation, however they will only be guides\n\n***Example of entire process:***\n\n> 1. Do a whole market asset selection analysis using good principles of quantitative asset selection\n> \n> 2. Decide ideal portfolio weights\n> \n> 3. Conduct indicator research\n> \n> 4. Score & Aggregate long term indicators\n> \n> 5. Adjust portfolio allocations based on valuations\n> >> If valuations are good, increase size\n> >> If valuations are neutral, hold\n> >> If valuations are bad, decrease size\n> \n> 6. The speed at which you increase or decrease positions will be determined by current market conditions\n\n***What can go wrong?***\n\nThere\u2019s not much that can go wrong in long term investing aside from lost opportunity cost.\n\nThis is an important principle. Opportunity cost is defined as the opportunity that you didn\u2019t take.\n\nWhen you\u2019re committed for a long time in one investment you might be closing yourself off to other quality investments.\n\nHowever with enough research you should be able to select the best opportunity from *day 1.*\n\n***What can go right?***\n\n> Long term investing is how the majority of people become millionaires from asset trading & management\n\n> The psyop that you can day trade your way to millions is not true for the majority of people\n\n> The majority of people can become rich easily using long term investing, it only requires patience.\n\n> With patience, 10x your money is basically guaranteed, you have to not fuck it up\n\n***Summary***\n\n> We\u2019re going to approach long term investing from the beta/passive/long-term angle\n\n> In order of importance we will look at\n> > Asset selection\n> > Long Term Valuation\n> > Strategic dollar cost averaging based on valuation\n\n> Long term investing is the most likely method that will make you rich",
