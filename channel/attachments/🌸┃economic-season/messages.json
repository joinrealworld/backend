Every rise continues to be questioned, until eventually, they aren't.\n\u200e\nInvestors who are new to the scene watch the buds sprout and bloom, mesmerized by the spectacle, hearts filled with the exhilaration of promise.\n\u200e\nExperienced investors, with past seasons etched into their minds, can't help but anticipate the sweltering heat of the summer that lies ahead over a much longer time horizon.\n\u200e\nIn Spring, markets climb a wall of worry with hesitant optimism, generally gravitating towards the upside, while still maintaining the risk of sudden downside.\n\u200e\nIn Spring, markets transition from a survival mode to a state of harmony which provides a weak safety net for the inexperienced, shielding them from some of the harsh consequences of their hubris.\n\u200e\nWhile the possibility of winter still looms, supernatural forces outside the control of the economic seasons suggest Summer is an increasing probability.\n\u200e",

On the deflation side we have the relentless contractionary pressures caused by higher interest rates.\n\u200e\nOf the 3 factors that drive macroeconomic asset sentiment the most, we understand that if growth and inflation do not provide strong signals, the most powerful factor of all, liquidity, will be the tiebreaker.\n\u200e\nSo what are liquidity trends?\n\u200e\nPut concisely, liquidity down in the very short term (this post will become obsolete quickly, ensure you\u2019re reading <#1075430627907752040> daily to catch updates on this), but liquidity up significantly in the longer term (several months to just over a year).",
