You choose what's right for you.\n\nMetamask is good, but its still just a piece of software.\n\nTo get ultimate crypto security you need a hardware/cold wallet.\n\n**\"Why don't you recommend ledger?\"**\n\n> Ledger tries too hard to innovate. This is a massive systemic risk.\n> \n> Compare ledger (constantly trying to make something better that was already fine) to BTC (something which never changes).\n> \n> BTC is the king because its security is already perfect and it can't be changed.\n> \n> Ledger is shit because they started with simplistic security they keep trying to change it through 'improvements'.\n> \n> These 'improvements' only lead to complexity and vulnerability.\n> \n> Can you see the conceptual problem here?\n> \n> We don't need improvements, we need reliability. The entire company philosophy is compromised.\n> \n> Recommend against ledger. Use Trezor.",
