We got a move down to that level and after taking the liquidity below price reversed and is back above $30k. BTC is stronger than the rest, still. I take a look at higher timeframes on BTC as well, as we approach a monthly, quarterly, and 1H (6 month) close tomorrow midnight.\n\u200e\nI then take a quick look at some alts, specifically LINK, BNB, and SOL to show how the alt market is dead.

Looking across the alt market, most alts are bearish and closed with bearish candles. I\u2019m still firmly bullish on BTC but short term more downside can come. Needs to stay above 27500 to hold the 12/21 EMA bands for the monthly chart.\n\u200e\nBTC paths\nAugust and September of pre halving year typically produce a pullback in crypto markets. But for today, it\u2019s important not to over react to the early month dip, as we normally see a wick on both sides of the candle. My expected path is drawn in the image below. I think ultimately we go lower at least one more time over the coming weeks for a shakeout, possibly like we did in June where price got choppy. Everyone is bullish BTC on high timeframe, so the low timeframes can get messy.\n\u200e",
