Additionally, short term trading requires too much time input and the emotional burden of execution is quite high.\n\nMy philosophy: \n> To form a process where there is an optimal balance between time deployed vs. maximising results.\n\nStrategy Goals: \n> Must reduce risk relative to buy-hold\n> Must maintain exposure to large bull-market moves\n> Must exploit opportunities for profit\n> Must reduce reliance on any single indicator\n\n***Strategy and Asset Selection***\n\n> In the realm of swing trading, asset selection can be important, but generally its not as important as the strategy itself. \n\n> This is because everything in the market is highly correlated. If all assets move mostly in the same direction over shorter terms, then the majority of the research must be on the strategy.\n\n> The strategy, therefore, becomes the main consideration, _and the asset simply becomes the vehicle for the strategy.\n\n> The strategy is the \u2018Alpha\u2019.\n\n> Some assets lend themselves better to algorithmic development, but that\u2019s a discussion for later in the masterclass.\n\n> For the most part, you\u2019ll want to choose BTC or ETH and swing trade using them.\n\n***Swing trade sophistication***\n\nWe will be broadly covering 3 strategies:\n\n> 1. Manual aggregation - We select a bunch of different indicators, combine them together and to create a bullish or bearish condition.\n\n> 2. Algorithmic design - We look to understand, select and combine automated strategies, to form a powerful portfolio.\n\n> 3. Python coding - Essentially #2 but with all steps fully automated. Covered In principle only, due to complexity. This means most of the detail will be in #1 & #2.\n\nNot everyone will have the desire to go all the way to the highest levels of sophistication.\n\nThats ok. You can still get great results from using #1, Manual aggregation.\n\n***Strategy Behavior***\n\n> While there will be opportunities to deploy both mean-reversion and trend-following analysis, the majority of the time we will be focusing on trend following because I believe it gives us the highest exposure to alpha.\n\n> This is mainly because gaining exposure to the positive skewness of BTC\u2019s returns is preferable, and cant be obtained by mean reversion.",

But first we must understand TIME.\n\n> Time is the thread which holds the fabric of the markets together. It is the common link between all assets and almost all analysis methods.\n\n> Its common for people to mix time horizons (swing trading with scalping) in a attempt to increase performance when they find an indicator they like.\n\n> Done naively, all this does is increase complexity and confusion with no increase in signal. \n\n***Issues***\n\n> To prevent the risk of being drawn into an infinite labyrinth of confusion, the investor must DEFINE beforehand the REFERENCE TIME FRAME they will operate over.\n\n> Failure to do this leads to people drowning in a sea of panic and confusion with every price move on every time frame, which is infinite in complexity.\n\n> Price delines 3% - \u201cIs now a good time to buy? RSI on the 30min chart is oversold\u201d\n> Price declines 15% - \u201cIs now a good time to buy? RSI on the 4hour chart is oversold\u201d\n> Price declines 40% - \u201cIs now a good time to buy? RSI on the 2day chart is oversold\u201d\n\n> All of these observations are subjective without an anchor defined by a strategy.\n\n***Issues Cont.***\n\n> Novices hit me up asking \u201cPrice is dipping on the 1 hour chart, I\u2019m a long term holder, is this a good time to buy?\u201d\n\n> If you can\u2019t see the issue here; you are the problem.\n\n> This is the equivalent of pulling out your magnifying glass to inspect a paint chip on a supertanker about to sail across the pacific ocean, not only are there 100 higher considerations, it\u2019s not a constructive use of an individual's mental capacity when starting out.\n\n> Over-optimisation is not viable until you have achieved mastery at a single scale across all analysis methods. This may take quite some time.\n\n***My Anchor / Guiding Star***\n\n> Much like celestial navigation, one must have an anchor point, or \u2018North Star\u2019 on which to contextualise the behavior of the market.\n\n> The trade offs for different \u2018anchor points\u2019 are apparent:\n\n> Short time frames: More opportunities, more work.\n\n> Longer time frames: Less opportunities, less work.\n\n> I have previously chosen the daily (1D) chart as my \u2018North Star\u2019.\n\n> (Now that I am more advanced, I do much of my swing analysis on all time frames between 1D and 1W)\n\n> I never perform analysis on a chart lower than 1D unless I am performing discretionary trading, and even then I only use the 12H. \n\n> No method on earth can make money on time horizons shorter than 4/6 hours, and that's at a global hedge fund level. \n\n> Don't be naive and think you're special because you have a pretty indicator, because it wont work. Stick to a reasonable time frame\n\n***Hierarchy of time frames***\n\n> Some context which may be important is the relative importance of different timeframes on analysis.\n\n> Generally, you\u2019ll find that the largest drivers of market price are often also the slowest, at the highest level, this would be things that affect the desire of people everywhere in the world to hold risky assets.\n\n> Economic growth, money supply, interest rates, inflation, etc.\n\n> This means analysis done on higher time frames (longer term) takes precedence.\n\n> Rule: High time frame (Years) > Low time frame (Minutes)",

Aka 'capturing skew'.\n\n> ***I need to make sure this is FUCKING crystal clear*** \ud83d\udc7a \n\n> ***LONG TERM VALUATION = MEAN REVERSION STYLE OF ANALYSIS***\n\n> ***MEDIUM TERM TREND FOLLOWING IS NOT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH LONG TERM VALUATION***\n\n***THE TWO DO NOT MIX***\n\n> ***IF YOU MIX THE TWO, ITS LIKE TRYING TO BAKE A CHOCOLATE BIRTHDAY CAKE WITH TOMATOES, PARMESAN, ANCHOVIES AND HOT-SAUCE.***\n\n> ***DON'T LET ME FIND YOU MAKING THIS MISTAKE***\n\n***How much analysis must be done?***\n\n> All methods of medium term market timing have flaws. There is no indicator that will guarantee you make money with a 100% hit rate, or even a 80% hit rate. \n\n> Many analytical methods by themselves are below 50% due to market competition.\n\n> This means we must diligently perform analysis using multiple techniques to gain a holistic, probabilistic edge in the market above random chance.\n\n> Obsessively trying to find the one magic indicator which will solve all of your problems will only lead to annihilation. \n\n> This is one of the problems systemization attempts to solve.\n\n***What Analysis Types?***\n\n> Looking at the hierarchy of analytical methods in the swing trading context, starting with - ***Systemization ***\n\n> This is technically a 'method' and not an 'indicator'. We are covering this in more detail in the following lessons.\n\n> These lessons will be on manual aggregation, tradingview strategies, and python as described in the introduction.\n\n> In these lessons we\u2019ll be collecting many different indicators and combining them together.\n\n***Fundamental Economics***\n\n> Supply and Demand happens over all time horizons, however the types of economic effects one can actually deploy over short time horizons is too advanced for this masterclass.\n\n> If you find indicators or data that fits into this category during your research, feel free to note them down for later use.\n\n***Macroeconomics - Limitations***\n\n> Macroeconomic effects have huge impacts in the crypto market. \n\n> However, Macroeconomic seasons as previously covered in long-term investing are too broad and do not provide much \u2018signal\u2019 over shorter time horizons.\n\n***Macroeconomics - Alternative approach***\n\n> Swing trading using macro effects can be based upon the understanding that if the stock market; cryptos most comparable risky asset class, is bullish... then crypto will also most likely be bullish as well.\n\n> How we determine if the stock market is bullish at a professional level is very difficult and could be its own lecture series. \n\n> Suffice to say it would also need to follow the hierarchy of analysis methods.\n\n> I keep my process very simple by applying some systemized technical analysis to rank the bullishness of stocks.\n\n> BTC\u2019s directionally implied relationship to other asset classes on short term basis can also be determined through asset trend and correlation analysis.\n\n***On-chain data \ud83d\udd17 ***\n\n> While there is some limited on chain data that operates over short time horizons, I have not seen many metrics which produce reliable trend signals.\n\n> Most on-chain data signals are concerned with overbought and oversold levels.\n\n> For this reason I do not incorporate on-chain data, but I am open to it should the right data arise.",

Then running them in a rule-based manner to minimise human discretion.\n\n> ***Automated systematic technical analysis: \ud83d\udd27 *** Using software to test indicators and produce statistical reports on their effectiveness. These statistical reports tell us if the indicator actually produces alpha. Then they can be deployed without human discretion.\n\n***Sentiment ***\n\n> In my experience I have not found any useful trend based sentiment indicators for the function of swing trading.\n\n***Analysis Risks***\n\n> At this point you\u2019ve probably recognized the main problem, and that is that there\u2019s a heavy reliance on systematic technical analysis over the other methods described.\n\n> Statistical significance, which is the category systematic technical analysis belongs to, is not very far up the hierarchy and therefore a suboptimal choice.\n\n> Personally I find it difficult to reconcile this as preferably I\u2019d want indicators higher up the list, but I have been unable to find many which are useful over a swing time horizon.\n\n> The redeeming factor in this situation is that the methodology of combining and running technical indicators can be done quite scientifically, and this is how I intend on staying as true as possible to the principles of systemization.\n\n***Summary***\n\n> We will be using trend following analysis for our swing trading\n> I am not yet aware of any fundamental economic, on-chain or sentiment based data that applies to swing trading.\n\n> I am aware of some macroeconomic and systemized technical analysis factors that apply to swing trading, so these will be the focus of our systems.",

Without a backtest you can never be sure if it will actually behave the way you expect.\n\n> There is a limitation to the speed and accuracy with which we can backtest TPI\u2019s due to their disparate construction.

Subconsciously, automation makes you think there's such a thing as a 'finished' system.\n\n> Once you code it all up and its working, then you get to enjoy the fruits of your labor and relax right? That's why we did it in the first place!\n\n> Wrong\n\n> I think the task of updating a system manually, forces you to comprehend if its actually doing what you want it to do.\n\n> Its very easy to not look at, and engage with the internals of your system once its complete.\n\n> Its like keeping icecream in your fridge and relying on your willpower to not eat it.\n\n> If you automate everything in your system you're relying on your willpower to go back and keep it updated.\n\n> Because I have all my systems semi-automated (i.e. the logic is fixed in a spreadsheet but the values are updated manually) I am always looking at how the system is working and thinking about its quality.\n\n> If you're running an automated system, you may miss out on this extra 'brain time' that would have been allocated to your systems over the long run.\n\n> Carefully consider if you have the discipline and habit to constantly re-visit the system before fully committing to automation, you might be inadvertently sealing your own fate.",
