If you can get more than 12 reps, the weight is too light.\n> \n> Once you've done 12 reps with a certain weight, you should increase the weight for the next set.\n> \n> For example, if you bench press 40kg for 12 reps, increase the weight to 45kg and do 8 or 9 reps.\n> \n> Time under tension (TUT) helps dictate the training stimulus. TUT is the amount of time your body, or a particular muscle or group of muscles, is under load.\n> \n> For muscle hypertrophy you need a time between 40 and up to 70 seconds of TUT.\n> \n> So if you bench press, and you normally drop the weight pretty quickly and push it back up quickly, then you might look at that as a tempo of 1010 or two seconds for each rep.\n> \n> Two seconds multiplied by 12 reps equals 24 seconds of TUT. This time limits your maximum gains in muscle mass.\n> \n> For bodybuilding purposes, time under tension (TUT) for each set should generally be in the 40-70 second range. Sets lasting less than 30 seconds tend to build speed, strength and power but don't build maximum muscle mass.\n> \n> You need at least 40 seconds of time under tension per set to stimulate maximum hypertrophy.",

You move down for three seconds.\n> \n> \u2981 The second number represents the time in seconds to pause at the lower end of the movement. In this case, there is no pause.\n> \n> \u2981 The third number is the upward movement, also known as concentric. In this case, 2 seconds.\n> \n> \u2981 The fourth number represents the time in seconds to pause at the upper end of the movement. Again, there is no pause.\n> \n> Time under tension is more important than the total number or reps.\n> \n> For a tempo of 3-0-2-0, you will train like this:\n> \n> \u2981 3 seconds eccentric movement\n> \u2981 0 seconds pause after the eccentric movement\n> \u2981 2 seconds concentric movement\n> \u2981 0 seconds pause after the concentric movement",
